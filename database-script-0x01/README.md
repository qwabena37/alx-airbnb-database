# Airbnb Database Schema — Normalised to 3NF

## 📦 Directory: `database-script-0x01`
This module defines the Airbnb database schema using SQL. It applies normalization principles to ensure the design is in **Third Normal Form (3NF)**.

---

## 🧱 Tables Defined
- `User`: Stores user profiles and roles.
- `Property`: Listings created by hosts.
- `Booking`: Reservation details.
- `Payment`: Linked to bookings.
- `Review`: Feedback from guests.
- `Message`: Communication between users.

---

## ✅ Normalisation Summary

### First Normal Form (1NF)
- All fields are atomic.
- No repeating groups.

### Second Normal Form (2NF)
- All non-key attributes fully depend on the primary key.

### Third Normal Form (3NF)
- No transitive dependencies.
- Derived fields like `total_price` are excluded from base tables.

> 💡 `total_price` can be calculated dynamically as:
> `DATEDIFF(end_date, start_date) × Property.pricepernight`

---

## 🔐 Constraints & Indexes
- Primary and foreign keys enforce referential integrity.
- ENUMs restrict values for roles, status, and payment methods.
- Indexes added for high-traffic columns (e.g., `email`, `property_id`, `booking_id`).

---

## 🧠 Notes
- UUIDs used for global uniqueness.
- Timestamp fields track creation and updates.
- Schema is optimized for scalability and clarity.
