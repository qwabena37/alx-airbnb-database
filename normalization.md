# Airbnb Database Normalisation to Third Normal Form (3NF)

## üéØ Objective
Apply normalisation principles to ensure the Airbnb database schema is in **Third Normal Form (3NF)** by eliminating redundancy, ensuring data integrity, and optimizing relational structure.

---

## üß† Normalisation Overview

### First Normal Form (1NF)
- Ensures atomicity: all fields contain indivisible values.
- ‚úÖ All tables in the schema meet 1NF.

### Second Normal Form (2NF)
- Achieved when:
  - The table is in 1NF.
  - All non-key attributes are fully functionally dependent on the **entire** primary key.
- ‚úÖ All tables with composite keys (e.g., none in this schema) are properly structured.

### Third Normal Form (3NF)
- Achieved when:
  - The table is in 2NF.
  - There are **no transitive dependencies** (i.e., non-key attributes do not depend on other non-key attributes).

## üîç Schema Review and Adjustments

### ‚úÖ `User`
- Already in 3NF.
- No transitive dependencies.
- `role` is atomic and ENUM is acceptable.

### ‚úÖ `Property`
- Already in 3NF.
- `host_id` references `User`, no derived or redundant fields.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è `Booking`
- Potential issue: `total_price` is derived from `pricepernight √ó number_of_nights`.
- ‚ùó **Fix**: Remove `total_price` from `Booking` and calculate it dynamically or move to a derived view.

### ‚úÖ `Payment`
- No transitive dependencies.
- Each payment is tied to a booking.

### ‚úÖ `Review`
- No transitive dependencies.
- `rating` and `comment` are directly related to the review.

### ‚úÖ `Message`
- No transitive dependencies.
- `sender_id` and `recipient_id` are atomic foreign keys.

## ‚úÖ Final Adjusted Schema Summary

### Booking (Adjusted)
```sql
booking_id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
property_id UUID FOREIGN KEY REFERENCES Property(property_id),
user_id UUID FOREIGN KEY REFERENCES User(user_id),
start_date DATE NOT NULL,
end_date DATE NOT NULL,
status ENUM('pending', 'confirmed', 'canceled') NOT NULL,
created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
-- Removed total_price
